# Project 1 Simon Game
## Technologies Used
The project was completed in HTML5, CSS and Javascript. There was a wide range of methods used in the project and in each contributing file. Within JS, DOM manipulation and setTimeout/setInterval were used to control much of the UI, and a combination of many individual functions guided gameplay. Within the CSS, principles of grid display were essential to organized layout. Additionally, media queries adjusted this layout for compatibility with smaller screens.
## Approach
Similar to many of the smaller scale projects we have completed this course, the process begins with a wireform and psuedocode. A basic layout is sketched up, making sure each integral component of the game is included. Once the wireform was completed, I began to create the HTML elements and their accompanying CSS. As it came together and actually took shape, layout modifications were necessary and warranted. 

With a moderately complete layout coded, I began writing javascript code. The first step was initializing many of the elements I would be manipulating and creating variables for many of the items that would assist in gameplay. Empty arrays were created to hold the random sequence of colors, the players answers and each players score and level. From there each of the individual functions could begin to be written and then threaded together. Many functions were composed of if-else statements and for loops. 

For player interaction with the game, addEventListeners logged inputs and executed functions to check answers. Lastly, an integral part of the game is various timed events which required setInterval and setTimeout functions. These had to be properly placed within the gameplay functions to fire elements at correct times.

## Installation
There are no special installation requirements.

## Unsolved Challenges
There were a few unsolved challenges. They were not crucial to completion of the game, just wouldve contributed to overall gameplay experience. Most forefront, I struggled to get the 'START' button placed correctly in the center over the circle board. I also struggled to properly adjust all my elements for mobile mode.
Additionally, there were many features that I would have liked to add given more time. I would have liked to add sound features, a high score that saves even with a page reload and made the gameboard more realistic.
