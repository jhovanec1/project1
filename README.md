## Project 1 Simon Game
### Approach
> Similar to many of the smaller scale projects we have completed this course, the process begins with a wireform and psuedocode. I sketched up a basic layout as I imagined making sure I included each make component of the game. Once I the wireform was completed, I began to create the HTML elements and their accompanying CSS.
