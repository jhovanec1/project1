# Project 1 Simon Game
## Technologies Used
> There was a wide range of technologies used in the project and in each contributing file. Within JS, DOM manipulation and setTimeout/setInterval were used to control much of the UI, and a combination of many individual functions guided gameplay. Within the CSS, principles of grid display were essential to organized layout. Additionally, media queries adjusted this layout for compatiability with smaller screens.
## Approach
> Similar to many of the smaller scale projects we have completed this course, the process begins with a wireform and psuedocode. I sketched up a basic layout as I imagined, making sure I included each component of the game. Once the wireform was completed, I began to create the HTML elements and their accompanying CSS. As it came together and actually took shape, modifications were necessary and warranted. With a moderately complete layout coded, I began writing code. The first step was initializing many of the elements I would be manipulating and creating variables for many of the items that would assist in gameplay.

## Installation
>There are no special installation requirements.

## Unsolved Challenges
>There were a few unsolved challenges. They were not crucial to completion to the game, just wouldve contributed to overall gameplay experience.
