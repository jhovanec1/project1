# Project 1 Simon Game

### Approach
> Similar to many of the smaller scale projects we have completed this course, the process begins with a wireform and psuedocode. I sketched up a basic layout as I imagined, making sure I included each component of the game. Once the wireform was completed, I began to create the HTML elements and their accompanying CSS. As it came together and actually took shape, modifications were necessary and warranted. With a moderately complete layout coded, I began writing code. The first step was initializing many of the elements I would be manipulating and creating variables for many of the items that would assist in gameplay.
